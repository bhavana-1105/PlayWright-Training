Anonymouss Function: An anonymous function is a function without a name. It is also known as a lambda function or a function expression.
Function expression: Function expression is a function that is assigned to a variable. They can be named or anonymous.
Difference between anonymous function and function expression: In function expression function can be called before defining the function
                                                               but in anonyms function, function can be called only after defining the function
                                                               otherwise Reference error will be observed
Prototype: Used to implement inheritance in JavaScript, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
           Every object in JavaScript has an internal [[Prototype]] property that points to its prototype object.
           When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks if the property or method exists on the object itself.
           If it doesn't, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it finds the property or method or reaches the end of the chain (null).
